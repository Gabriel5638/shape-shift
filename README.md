# Market Research

Market research unveils a growing trend among health-conscious individuals seeking both performance and style in their fitness apparel. ShapeShift, a B2C platform, targets this clientele, offering a curated selection of high-quality activewear and accessories.

Much like luxury cars symbolize status, fitness apparel has become a statement of dedication to wellness. Shapeshift is aiming to promote itself by driving an increased interest in premium fitness wear that seamlessly blends functionality and fashion.

Statistics highlight a rising consumer inclination towards investing in top-tier activewear. ShapeShift's B2C model strategically positions it to cater to this evolving demand, providing consumers with a range of stylish yet performance-driven options. It's a go-to destination for those seeking to enhance their fitness journey with premium, trendsetting activewear.

## Target Audience

From the research I've done on sites like Google Analytics and Statista.com there are THREE types of people who "Shapeshift" will appeal to.

### Lower Class: 
People who do not have lots of money can still find the website appealing as it offers free diet and workout advice and can buy acessories as they do not cost a lot.


### Middle Class :

People who make average income and can afford  some of the clothes that are on offer and acessories.

### Wealthy People :

People that can afford to buy anything on the website as they make a lot of money and are looking for either very expensive sport clothes which the website has or they are looking for cool acessories.

## Market Strategy

### Utilizing Facebook as our primary marketing platform presents an opportunity to reach a vast audience of potential customers. With its extensive user base and diverse targeting options, we can tailor our campaigns to resonate with specific demographics interested in fitness, fashion, and active lifestyles.


We would use the shapeshift facebook page to create campaigns and promote our page by boosting our posts and using facebook ads.

### Our secondary marketing platform is Instagram as it has a lot of users interested in working out and clothing and works very well with Facebook.

On Instagram we could collab with a popular instagram user and ask them to promote our shapeshift merch we would send them free clothes and acessories and ask them for a promotion or a hashtag in return to create views and potential customers for our website.

## Mailchimp

Our newsletter sign-up is a vital part of our marketing strategy. It lets users subscribe for exclusive promotions and updates. The collected email lists enable our admin to send subscribers rewards, discounts, and insider info, fostering a loyal customer base.


# Agile

In order to complete this project I have used the Agile Methodology. This involves breaking down the project into smaller tasks called User Stories. These user stories were added using githubs Issues functionality. Each user story was made into an issue and added to the projects kanban board. 


You can view my user stories in the kanban [board here.](https://github.com/users/Gabriel5638/projects/7/views/1)

# User Experience

## Scope

In order to present the user with a compelling experience and have him enjoy his visit on our website, Shapeshift needs to tick a few boxes. The list below is an absolute must if we would like the user to return and recommend us to others.

Shapeshift needs to have these features: 


- Users can create and maintain their accounts using Django All-Auth registration and functionality.

- A landing page that makes it very apparent what the site is used for.

- A user profile page where users may view their order history and save billing information for quicker orders in the future.

- A Products Page that displays all of the Products found in the category or through the search.

- Products Cards that display an image of the item, its name, price, and an option to click for further information.

- A Search Bar, My Account Links, Shopping Cart Links, and Product Categories sections are included in the site navigation.

# Design Scheme
To make this project stand out among other fitness websites that offer similar things I decided to offer free diets and workout routines and make the pages look very attractive and flashy especially the diet page using videos of food related to the specific diet as where other subscription based websites ask for money I would offer these for free to attract customers.

This was done with aid of cool videos, of foods being prepared I found on pexels I will go more into detail about them in the "Features" section.
