## Target Audience

From the research I've done on sites like Google Analytics and Statista.com there are THREE types of people who "Shapeshift" will appeal to.

### Lower Class: 
People who do not have lots of money can still find the website appealing as it offers free diet and workout advice and can buy acessories as they do not cost a lot.


### Middle Class :

People who make average income and can afford  some of the clothes that are on offer and acessories.

### Wealthy People :

People that can afford to buy anything on the website as they make a lot of money and are looking for either very expensive sport clothes which the website has or they are looking for cool acessories.

## Market Strategy

### Utilizing Facebook as our primary marketing platform presents an opportunity to reach a vast audience of potential customers. With its extensive user base and diverse targeting options, we can tailor our campaigns to resonate with specific demographics interested in fitness, fashion, and active lifestyles.


We would use the shapeshift facebook page to create campaigns and promote our page by boosting our posts and using facebook ads.


![facebook](media/facebook.PNG)

### Our secondary marketing platform is Instagram as it has a lot of users interested in working out and clothing and works very well with Facebook.

On Instagram we could collab with a popular instagram user and ask them to promote our shapeshift merch we would send them free clothes and acessories and ask them for a promotion or a hashtag in return to create views and potential customers for our website.

## Mailchimp

Our newsletter sign-up is a vital part of our marketing strategy. It lets users subscribe for exclusive promotions and updates. The collected email lists enable our admin to send subscribers rewards, discounts, and insider info, fostering a loyal customer base.

# Agile

In order to complete this project I have used the Agile Methodology. This involves breaking down the project into smaller tasks called User Stories. These user stories were added using githubs Issues functionality. Each user story was made into an issue and added to the projects kanban board. 


You can view my user stories in the kanban [board here.](https://github.com/users/Gabriel5638/projects/7/views/1)

# User Experience

## Scope

In order to present the user with a compelling experience and have him enjoy his visit on our website, Shapeshift needs to tick a few boxes. The list below is an absolute must if we would like the user to return and recommend us to others.

- A landing page that makes it very apparent what the site is used for.

- A user profile page where users may view their order history and save billing information for quicker orders in the future.

- A Products Page that displays all of the Products found in the category or through the search.

- Products Cards that display an image of the item, its name, price, and an option to click for further information.

- A Search Bar, My Account Links, Shopping Cart Links, and Product Categories sections are included in the site navigation.

# Design Scheme
In crafting this website to shine amidst its counterparts, I've innovated by introducing a pioneering food tracker and journal app exclusively for registered users. This unique feature empowers individuals to effortlessly monitor their dietary habits, a rarity among comparable platforms I've extensively researched. Coupled with a sleek, user-friendly layout, the interface boasts simplicity and intuitiveness. The carefully chosen color palette further enriches the user experience, ensuring a seamless journey through the site's functionalities.

### Colors

 I opted for a black and white color scheme to ensure that users can easily read and engage with the content on my website. This timeless combination not only looks sophisticated but also creates a clean, distraction-free environment. It helps maintain a consistent style while ensuring accessibility for everyone visiting the site.

I used COOLORS to generate this:

![colors](media/blacknwhite.PNG)


## Fonts

- I used a font named Montserrat because I beleive it matches the website look and feel well, after testing other fonts. 

- You can find the font here [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat)


## Images

- Images for products were taken from Pintrest website, Pintrest had many product images and models I found useful.

- The Hero image was taken from Pexels.


# Data Scheme

- Used DrawSQL to present my models

![data](media/datamodel.PNG)


## Header

- You can also see the shopping cart icon for acessing the items before going to checkout. 

![header](media/header.PNG)

## Footer

![footer](media/footer.PNG)
- The search bar is positioned at the bottom to avoid conflicting with the navigation bar and to ensure clear differentiation between the two elements for the user.

- I have links to Facebook, Tumblr, Reddit in the footer section icons can be clicked to take the user to shapeshift Facebook page or to acess tumblr or reddit for telling others about the website.

- To avoid diverting the user, when an icon is clicked, the page will open in a new tab.

## Tags
![hero](media/tags.PNG)

- I've made sure to add lots of descriptive keywords in meta tags ands aria labels in most of my code just to improve SEO.

## robots.txt 

- I also added a file called robots.txt that instructs the search engine where to look and where not to look in our site, this also improves SEO a lot.


# STRIPE

- On this project we implemented a service called Stripe to handle payments from our customers.
- Once you set up webhooks successfully you should be able to see payments succeed in your Stripe dashboard.

    - Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
    - expiry: any date in the future
    - cvc: any 3 digits

# Testing

I have conducted thorough testing of the website, as well as some close friends who I have instructed to test the site.

## Manual Testing

## User Story Testing

1. As a user I can use the recover password options so that to recover my password in case i forget

    - The 'Forgot Password' option at the bottom of the login page was used to test this. A link is then sent to the user through email, so I tested this with an already-sent email to be sure the link was received.

    - The user must wait for the password reset link to be received before using it. Once it does, they are directed to a website where they must input their old password twice in order to reset it. The user is led to a confirmation page with a bootstrap toast displaying a success message after entering the new password. An error notice alerts the user so they can try again if the passwords do not match.


2. As a user I can easily register for an account on the website so that receive benefits of a logged in user

    - This was tested by registering a couple of user accounts and:
        - making sure they worked by logging out and back in.
        - clicking the confirmation link in the email
        - scanning for verified email addresses in the admin panel.
        - using an already-existing email address to attempt to create an account
        - checked if logged in user can acess foodtracker section.
        - checked if logged in user can acess review questions section.

    - I also added an address to my profile and made an attempt to complete a checkout to test the information. The address saved in the profile was automatically filled up on the checkout page as a result. To further test this, I placed an order while making sure the user's profile address was saved and the box to save details to the profile was checked.

 3. As a user I can search by using a simple searchbar so that i can find exactly what product I want to buy
    - I tested this by searching using the search bar in the footer and also by searching through the category links


4. As a user I can sort product by specific category easily so that i can choose which type of product I want

    - I went to the all product section and tested all the sorting options. 
        - this included : Sort by name, sort by category and sort by price.
        - all of those options returned expected results


6. As a user I can see my order details so that i can verify my purchase
    - I selected a product put in the detail such as size and material, then I clicked add to bag and secure checkout
    - I was presented with the order details after I clicked on secure checkout
    - I tried multiple times with various values trying to trick the form but it worked every time

7. As a user I can pay safely without having to worry about my details being stolen so that i can shop with confidence
    - If the user has an account, address details can be saved and updated/removed as needed. By adding and deleting addresses from the profile page, this was put to the test. In order to verify that the address was saved on the User's Profile page after checkout, it was also inserted and saved to the profile.

    - The project makes use of Stripe to handle payments, protecting customer payment information and preventing it from being saved in their user profile.

8. As a user I can adjust the products in my cart so that I can remove them if needed or add more products
    - I added a product to my cart then went to the cart page
    - Once on the page i was presented with the correct information as expected
    - I deleted the product succesfully and was greeted with product removed toast
    - I added more products via the keep shopping button and the cart was updated
    - I tried multiple times to trick the system by refreshing the page etc.

9. As a user I can buy products without being logged in  so that I dont need to create an account before buying
    - Without being logged in, I added a product to cart and went to secure checkout , added the information such as name adress etc, and the payment went trough with no errors, as I was taken to the product sucess page with the details such as the product price and delivery info

10. As a user I can easily view a list of products ** so that ** I can decide what to buy
    - Once I clicked on any of the product categories from the navigation I was presented with the product cards and prices.
    - The products are displayed using bootstrap cards and are very responsive due to their classes, which means the layout of the cards changes with screen size.
    - All images are displayed inside the cards with no problems.

11. As a user I can click on a specific product  so that see relevant information about its caracteristics
    - I clicked on a product with the picture of a keychain, it took me to the product detail page

    - By subscribing with a test email and logging into Mailchimp to view the contacts, the subscription was tested. After making sure the contact was present, I scanned the page to check if they had subscribed and was also able to send newsletter campaigns to subscribed emails.

13. As a user I can add payment info easily when checking out so that I dont have to spend much time before buying

    - I scrolled down to the footer where the facebook icon is located
    - Click on the Icon and was taken directly to their facebook page
    - It opened in a new window as expected and didnt close the previous one

15. As a user I can add products into my shopping cart  so that I can see how much i am spending and the total cost
    - I checked to make sure the right product was added before adding an item to the cart.

    - In order to make sure the quantity in the cart matched what was added, I raised the quantity before adding it.

16. As a user I can receive a confirmation email when registering so that click the confirmation link be sure i am registered
    - By sending an order to an email address that can be verified, email confirmation was tried. The right order data and a contact email were included in an email confirmation that was sent in accordance with the template set up in the checkout app.


17. As a superuser I can add products so that I can have more products available to buy
    - Both the Admin Panel and the project management page, which can be accessed by clicking on "My Account," can be used to add products. Both methods of adding products were evaluated, and the products that were tested could be seen both in the models as well as in the page.

18. As a superuser I can edit a product so that I can change its price, details, description
    - You can edit a product entry in two ways, one using the admin panel and another using the edit button which appears if youre logged in as superuser.

    - Also checked the admin panel for editing and it was the same situation everything worked without issue

    - That can be done from the admin panel by clicking on their email and selecting the remove option.

20. As a superuser I can send emails to customers so that **I can more easily market my available stock of products or send them news about our store
    - When a customer signs up for emails, their information is added to the company's Mailchimp contacts list, where they can later be removed.

    - This was checked by sending an email to subscribe and then verifying that it was received by checking the Mailchimp email list. In order to make sure it was simple to remove an email from the email list, I also looked at the unsubscribe functionality.

21. As a superuser I can add different categories of products or change existing categories** so that I am able to manage each entry properly
